# Homebridge Bose SoundTouch

[🇩🇪 Deutsche Version](README.de.md)

A Homebridge plugin for controlling Bose SoundTouch speakers via Apple HomeKit.

**Fully functional after the Bose Cloud shutdown (May 2026)** - Radio, NAS and hardware buttons work without cloud via local DLNA.

## Features

- **Auto Discovery** - Finds SoundTouch devices automatically via mDNS
- **MAC-based Identification** - Devices are identified by MAC address, DHCP IP changes are resolved automatically and saved to config
- **External Accessories** - Each device appears as a standalone accessory in HomeKit
- **Television Service** - Full control via Apple TV Remote in Control Center
- **Internet Radio** - Custom radio stations as HTTP streams (runs via DLNA, no cloud needed)
- **NAS/DLNA** - Music from NAS servers as presets with album playback and auto-next-track (includes browser wizard)
- **Hardware Buttons** - Physical preset buttons 1-6 on the speaker work again! The plugin intercepts the button press via WebSocket and plays the configured content via DLNA
- **Spotify & Amazon Music** - Streaming services still supported
- **Multi-Room** - Group speakers via HomeKit switch - one tap to add/remove a speaker from the zone. Master is auto-detected.
- **Optional TV Source** - Enable a momentary HomeKit button and input-menu item that selects the Bose TV input
- **Auto-Reconnect** - Offline devices retry every 30 seconds
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connection for instant status changes in HomeKit
- **Volume Slider** - Volume as brightness slider in Home app
- **Bass Control** - Bass slider in Home app (if device supports it)
- **Auto-Resume** - Optionally resume last preset on power on
- **Preset Buttons** - Choose between dropdown menu or separate switch per preset in HomeKit

## Bose Cloud Shutdown (May 2026)

The Bose SoundTouch Cloud was shut down on May 6, 2026. This plugin fully replaces cloud functionality:

| Feature | Before Shutdown | After Shutdown (this plugin) |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Radio Streams | Via Bose Cloud | Direct via DLNA (port 8091) |
| NAS/DLNA | Via STORED_MUSIC source | Direct via DLNA (port 8091) |
| Hardware Buttons | Via Bose Cloud presets | WebSocket interception + DLNA |
| Spotify | Spotify Connect | Spotify Connect (unchanged) |
| Amazon Music | Via Bose Cloud | Direct (unchanged) |
| TuneIn | Via Bose Cloud | **No longer available** - use HTTP streams instead |

## Installation

### Via Homebridge UI

1. Search for `homebridge-bose-soundtouch-tv-source` in the plugin search
2. Click "Install"

### Manual via npm

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-bose-soundtouch-tv-source
```

## Adding Devices to HomeKit

This plugin uses **External Accessories**:

1. **Start Homebridge** - Devices are shown in the log with a setup code
2. **Open Home app** on iPhone/iPad
3. **Tap "+"** then **"Add Accessory"**
4. **Tap "More options..."**
5. **Select device** (e.g. "Kitchen Bose 3BB1")
6. **Enter setup code** (default: 324-52-000)
7. **Assign room**
8. **Repeat** for each device

**Important:** The Child Bridge itself does **not** need to be added to HomeKit. Only add the individual speaker accessories. This plugin uses External Accessories which appear independently - if you add the Child Bridge instead, no speakers will show up.

**Important:** Devices only appear if mDNS works correctly. With Docker, the container must use either `--network host` or `macvlan`. If other mDNS services (e.g. Matter Server) conflict on port 5353, use `macvlan` with a dedicated IP.

## How It Works

### Radio & NAS (Post Cloud Shutdown)

The Bose firmware disabled `LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO`, `INTERNET_RADIO` and `STORED_MUSIC` source types after the cloud shutdown. This plugin uses **DLNA/UPnP on port 8091** (`SetAVTransportURI`) to send audio URLs directly to the speaker. Track/station names are displayed on the speaker via DIDL-Lite metadata.

### Hardware Buttons

Physical preset buttons 1-6 send a `nowSelectionUpdated` WebSocket event with the preset ID. The plugin catches this event, waits for the device to finish internal processing, then plays the configured content via DLNA.

### NAS Album Playback

All tracks from an album/folder are loaded from MiniDLNA via UPnP Browse. The plugin plays them sequentially - when a track ends (`STOP_STATE` via WebSocket), the next track starts automatically.

### Multi-Room

Each speaker has a "Group" switch in HomeKit. When turned on, the speaker joins the zone of the currently playing master. The master is auto-detected (the first speaker that is playing). Zone state syncs in real-time via WebSocket `zoneUpdated` events. Siri: "Hey Siri, turn on Group Kitchen".

### TV Source

Set `tvSourceEnabled` to `true` for a linked momentary "TV Source" button and final input-menu item. Tapping either sends `POST /select` with `source="PRODUCT"` and `sourceAccount="TV"`, then resets the button to off. It does not power the speaker down. Set `auxEnabled` or `bluetoothEnabled` to `false` to hide those entries from the input menu.

### IP Management

At startup, the plugin scans for all SoundTouch devices via mDNS and matches them by MAC address (`deviceID`). Changed IPs are automatically written back to `config.json`.

## HomeKit Features

### Television Service
- **On/Off** - Power On/Off
- **Input Selection** - Configured presets, AUX, Bluetooth
- **Remote Control** - Play/Pause, Next/Previous, Volume

### Input Sources
- **Preset 1-6** - Only configured presets are shown, empty slots are hidden
- **AUX** - AUX input
- **Bluetooth** - Bluetooth source

### Volume Control
Each device has a "Lautstärke" service (as a light with brightness slider):
- **Brightness** = Volume (0-100%)
- **On/Off** = Mute

### Bass Control
If the device supports bass adjustment, a "Bass" service appears:
- **Brightness** = Bass level (0-100% mapped to device range, e.g. -9 to 0)
- **On/Off** = Bass at default or minimum

## Supported Devices

- SoundTouch 10
- SoundTouch 20 / 20 Series III
- SoundTouch 30 / 30 Series III
- SoundTouch 300
- SoundTouch Portable
- SoundTouch SA-5 Amplifier
- Wave SoundTouch

**Note:** Newer Bose devices (Home Speaker 500, 700, Soundbar 550 etc.) use a different API and are not supported.

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Don't Appear in "Add Accessory"

mDNS is not working correctly. Common causes:
1. **Docker with `--network host`**: Other containers (e.g. Matter Server) block port 5353. Solution: Switch Homebridge to `macvlan` with its own IP.
2. **Multiple mDNS stacks**: Only one mDNS service should be active. Check with `ss -ulnp | grep 5353`.
3. **Wrong network interface**: Select the correct interface (e.g. `eth0`) in Homebridge settings.

### Radio Doesn't Play

- Stream URL must be **HTTP**, not HTTPS (auto-converted)
- Test the URL directly: `curl -I http://your-stream-url.mp3`
- Check logs for "DLNA error"

### NAS/DLNA Doesn't Work

- MiniDLNA must be running: `curl http://NAS-IP:8200`
- The ObjectID must be current - use the NAS browser in the plugin UI

### Hardware Buttons Don't Respond

- The plugin must be running and connected via WebSocket
- Check log for: `hardware button X pressed`
- The preset must be configured in Homebridge settings
